            <div class="info-domain">
              <p>
                Symbolism was a late 19-century art movement originated with a group of French poets that subsequently spread to figurative arts and music.  It was born in France on the initiative of Jean Moreas who published its Manifesto in <i>“Le Aro”</i> on the 18th of September 1886.
                Symbolism originated in the revolt of certain French poets against the rigid both technique and theme in traditional French poetry. 
                It is inspired by one of Charles Baudelaire’s most famous poems, <i>“Correspondences”</i>. In the latter, the French poet writes that all things have a mysterious bond between them hence often one recalls the other. Baudelaire will be recognized as the master of Symbolism followed later by Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé. 
                As stated by Rimbaud, in Symbolism the poet is seen as a seer who is able to see deeply, beyond the illusory appearances of sensible reality. The symbolists wish to free poetry from its expository functions and its formalized oratory in order to describe instead the fleeting, immediate sensations of man’s inner life and experience.
                In virtue of this they exploit a poetic language extremely rarefied. This conception leads to several formal innovations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> the use of a language made up of symbols, that is, of images and expressions that refer to something mysterious and indefinable;</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i>traditional syntax and metric forms breakdown;</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i>normal logical connections are neglected in order to proceed through apparently meaningless juxtapositions;</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="section-header">
              <p> <span> Symbolism and Romanticism </span></p>
              </div>
              <p>
              There are some elements of continuity between Romanticism and Symbolism. We can find almost all the same trends and themes in both currents. They tend to depict negative issues of their time having a strong reaction against modern industrial capitalism that destroys traditional life with the use of machinery. This causes man to have tendencies of monopolistic concentration. 
              The main difference is instead in the vision of the artist. The romantic poet has a titanic and heroic attitude towards reality, with a strong spirituality. Furthermore, Romanticism had constructive ambitions aiming at reflecting the totality and therefore exalting nature and all that is spontaneous. 
              On the other hand, the symbolist is irrational, and flees to an ideal elsewhere with fatigue and weakness that lead him to reflect not on the totality but on the fracture. 

              </p>
            <div class="section-header">
            <p> <span> Themes </span></p>
            </div>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Vague: </strong> </div><p> The sake for the vague and the melancholic is one of the main characteristics of Symbolism. The idea is to see the mysterious bond between symbols in the world that speak to us with a mysterious language understandable just through art.
            This leads to the concept of inaccuracy for which the poem must be like a dream, something indeterminate and indefinite, perhaps with some errors.
             </p>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Musicality:  </strong> </div> <p><i>“Music and still Music”</i> used to say Verlaine. 
            Not by chance great attention is given to the musical and phono symbolic values of the word that can evoke something not only through its meaning but also through its phonos. 
            Whereby poetry becomes music:  a musical flow that spreads without rules in a free and autonomous way. 
            </p>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Escape:  </strong> </div> <p> The rebellion towards reality is expressed in the escape motif. The boredom of the daily routine generates in the poet the desire for a life which is far from its falsehood. 
            </p>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Journey:  </strong> </div> <p> 
              The journey in literature combines the real with the fantastic and the encounter with the unusual and the unclear.
               For symbolists, the theme of the journey is used to define all the discomfort of living in 
              contact with a society in which they do not recognise themselves
            </p>
              <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Seer poet:  </strong> </div> <p>The poet becomes a seer, who perceives illuminations through his senses from the unknown. 
              This unknown world is not located outside, but present and hidden in the hell of the soul of the poet himself. 
              Reality is appearance and it is up to him to go further to grasp the secret correspondences. 
              </p>
              <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Spleen:  </strong> </div> <p>It is a form of existential anguish but referred to the sensitive nature of the poet as a whole and his inability to adapt to the real world. This results into the inability to react to paralyzing boredom. 
              </p>
              <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Purity:  </strong> </div> <p> There is the idea of poem as pure and centered on sensations, a musical transposition of the states of the soul. 
              </p>

              <p>
              The aim of the project is to extract knowledge from three poems, written by three different poets, belonging to the same literary genre. 
              We wanted to give an exhaustive overview
              of Symbolism, hence we chose its major exponents that are: 
              Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé. 
              In order to make it possible we created a specific ontology
              for the analysis of the following poems:
              <i>“Voyelles”</i> by Rimbaud, <i>“Brise Marine”</i> by Mallarmé and 
              <i>“Art Poétique"</i> by Verlaine. The combination of these last ouvres
              carries the key principles and themes of the literary movement.
              The analysis of the texts focuses on the individuation of 
              figure of speeches and ricurrent themes highlighting them. These information
              are present both in the ontology
              and in this webpage in the <a href="analysis.html" style="color: #b0955e;">poem</a> section.
              Through the aforementioned page we meant to extract knowledge of 
              the chosen domain, giving hyperlink connection to reliable sources.

                In order to formalise the goal we talked about in the previous section, we drawn up some competency questions. A competency question is a natural language question outlining and constraining the scope of knowledge represented in an ontology. <br>

            <div class="info-domain collbut">
              <p>
                In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a 
                representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories or classes, properties,
                and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one,
                many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of 
                showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, 
                by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.
                The aim is to define a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in 
                a field. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the topic
                and relations among them.
                Every academic discipline creates ontologies to limit complexity
                and organize data into information and knowledge. Each uses ontological
                assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. In order to create our ontology we used c, a software for developing
                and maintaining ontologies. 
                <br>
                In our <a href="index-en.html" style="color: #b0955e;">SimbO</a>ntology 
                we started with the establishment of 6 classes:
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> <button id="nocoll">LiteraryCurrent</button></li>
                  <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> <button id="collapsible">FigureOfSpeech</button></li>
                  <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> <button id="collapsible">Line</button></li>     
                  <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> <button id="collapsible1">Person</button></li>
                    <div id="contentcoll1"><ul>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> Poet</li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                  <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> <button id="nocoll">Theme</button></li>
                  <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> <button id="nocoll">Poem</button></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                The first class  – LiteraryCurrent - refers to Symbolism but also to Decadentism and Romanticism that are the two movements that influenced the most the authors. StéphaneMallarmé, ArthurRimbaud and PaulVerlaine are the individuals belonging to the class Poet. 
                As shown above this last is subclass of Person. The exponent of Decadentism that we decided to take in consideration is Charles Baudelaire, while for Romanticism Francesco Petrarca and Gabriele D'Annunzio. Secondly, we created a class useful for the representation of the poems: Poem.
                This has three individuals: ArtPoetique, BriseMarine and Voyelles.
                These last are composed of individuals of class Line that are respectively: LineAP, LineBM and LineV. For the achievement of our goal it was necessary to add two more classes, Theme and FigureOfSpeech. Their individuals are respectively: Vague, Spleen, Escape, Journey, Purity, Musicality, SeerPoet and Allitteration, Anaphora, Antithesis, Assonance, Enjambement, Hypallage, Metaphore, Oxymoron, Paronomasia, Personification, Synaesthesia and Synecdoche. Each theme is expressed by a line, each line contains a figure of speech.

            We decided to use Widoco in order to publish and create an enriched and customized documentation of our ontology. <a href="index-en.html" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find the Widoco documentation. 
           Thanks to Widoco it is also possible to validate the ontology with OOPS. <a href="oopsEval.html" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find the OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner! (OOPS!) evaluation.
